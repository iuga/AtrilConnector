Publishing your notebooks from RStudio to Atril is extremely simple. Once you are satisfied with your work and ready to publish, just click the 'Upload & Publish' button on the Addins dropdown, and follow the instructions. Once published, the post will become available with the given short-link.

# Quick Start

The project is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/iuga/AtrilConnector) but the installation is super easy and you need only a couple of seconds:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("iuga/AtrilConnector")
```

After complete, you can launch the addin from the `Addins` dropdown on the RStudio IDE or `Tools > Addins > Browse addings ... > atrilconnector > Execute`.

# Configuration

The addin only needs your api key to work that you can find on your [settings page](https://www.atril.me/#/settings). The first time the addin is launched will ask you this value, it will store it on a configuration file in your home folder: `~/.atril`. You can modify the file if needed.

# Usage

1. Open the `.Rmd` file you want to compile and publish.
2. Click on "Upload & Publish" option on the Atril connector addin.
3. You will see the title and description of your report extracted from the title and subtitle from the yml header. Only the title is requried.
4. Select the community you want to puslish in. You will see only the ones you have access.
5. Choose the output format, we recommend `HTML`
6. Click on "Upload & Publish"
7. Open the final post link
